# Pathfinding App

GUI to visualize the different pathfinding algorithms: Breadth First Search, Dijkstra, Greedy BFS, and A*.

## App Features:
- Different pathfinding searches
- Create obstacles for the algorithm (walls or water)
- Move the the start and end nodes

## Requirements:
- pygame==1.9.6

## What I Learned:

- Improve with the Pygame package
- Improved my OOP comprehension with Python
- Basics and implementation of the different path finding algorithms
